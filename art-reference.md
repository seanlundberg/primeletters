## Core Art Style

### Primary Style: **Romantic Realism with Painterly Softness**
Think Norman Rockwell meets vintage romance novel covers, with a touch of soft-focus cinematography from classic Hollywood films.

**Key Characteristics**:
- **Soft, diffused lighting** - Golden hour glow, warm amber tones, gentle shadows
- **Painterly texture** - Not photorealistic, but illustrated with visible brushstrokes that add warmth
- **Muted, warm color palette** - Creams, soft pinks, warm grays, golden yellows, dusty rose, sage green
- **Selective focus** - Main subject clear, background softly blurred (like a shallow depth of field)
- **Emotional clarity** - Faces and gestures convey warmth, kindness, gentle confidence
- **Period-accurate details** - 1950s fashion, cars, architecture, but not overly stylized

### Secondary Influence: **Vintage Illustration & Mid-Century Advertising**
- Think Saturday Evening Post covers, vintage Coca-Cola ads, classic romance paperback art
- Clean compositions, idealized but relatable characters
- Optimistic, wholesome, aspirational
